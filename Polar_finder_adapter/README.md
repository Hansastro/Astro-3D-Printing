The purpose of this adapter is to mount a canon 90° finder to a polar finder. The ajustement of the mount is very easier, particularly for the people who live quite in north.

Two adapters are provided:
- one for canon 90° finder to a ioptron skytracker polar finder.
- one for canon 90° finder to a Skywatcher EQ6 mount polar finder

The diameter is the same just the length change.

Those adapter are usable on other polar finder.
